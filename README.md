# BiPAP Therapy Settings Adjustment using Machine Learning

This Python code demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be used to dynamically adjust BiPAP therapy settings based on patient data. The code includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and therapy settings prediction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

    ```
    pip install pandas scikit-learn
    ```

3. Open the Python script in a text editor or Python IDE.

4. Customize the `patient_data` and `therapy_settings` DataFrames with your own patient data and corresponding therapy settings.

5. Run the Python script:

    ```
    python bipap_therapy_adjustment.py
    ```

6. The script will train a Random Forest Regressor model, perform hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search Cross-Validation, evaluate the model's performance, and predict therapy settings for new patient data.

## Sample Patient Data

- The `patient_data` DataFrame contains patient features such as respiratory rate, tidal volume, inspiratory pressure, expiratory pressure, sleep stage, and oxygen saturation.
- Customize this DataFrame with your own patient data.

## Sample BiPAP Therapy Settings

- The `therapy_settings` DataFrame contains corresponding BiPAP therapy settings such as mode, inspiratory pressure level, expiratory pressure level, and breath rate.
- Customize this DataFrame with your own therapy settings.

## Notes

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering steps are not extensively shown in this example but can be added as needed for your specific use case.
- Model performance evaluation is done using Mean Squared Error. Additional metrics and visualizations can be added for a more comprehensive evaluation.
- Ensure that you have a sufficient amount of high-quality patient data for model training and validation.
- Always consult with medical professionals before making any adjustments to patient therapy settings based on model predictions.
